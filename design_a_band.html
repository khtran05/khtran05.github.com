    <h2>Band Biography</h2>
    <p>
      
 
    </p>
    Viridescens came together from a group of teens (4 people) who were making cover musics. However, 
they needed to come up with a name for their band, so they tried to think of a name. They wanted to have a name that people would know. 
So, they came up with viridescens. Means to be free. They were doing cover songs and they were going viral. They were so 
popular that a music company wanted them to join, so they did. They made pop music for their fans, and a couple rock. 
They’re so popular that they have their first album called “Music to free itself”, music will make you feel free. On their first cover video, 
they had over 2 million views. Next, they started to make more videos and they started to become a new band group call, Viridescens, for permanent.
